\usage{
sm_compute(m, metric_id, ...)

sm_metric_subset(m, metric_id = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{A \code{segmetric} object.}

\item{metric_id}{A \code{character} vector with metrics id to be computed.}

\item{...}{Any additional argument to compute
a metric (see Details).}
}
\value{
Return a \code{numeric} vector with computed metric.
}
\description{
The \code{sm_compute()} computes a given metric (\code{metric_id} parameter) from
segmentation objects. It compares the reference to the segmentation
polygons using a metric.

A list with all supported metrics can be obtained
by \code{sm_list_metrics()} (see Details for more information).

The \code{sm_metric_subset()} returns the subset used to compute the metrics
in segmetric object.
